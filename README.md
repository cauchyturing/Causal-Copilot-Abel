## Introduction
Identifying causality lets scientists look past correlations and uncover the mechanisms behind natural and social phenomena. Although many advanced methods for causal discovery now exist, their varied assumptions and technical complexity often discourage non‑experts from using them.

**Causal‑Copilot** addresses this gap. Guided by a LLM, it automates the full causal‑analysis workflow: data inspection, algorithm and hyperparameter selection, code generation, uncertainty assessment, and PDF report creation— all triggered through simple dialogue. By combining LLM‑driven domain knowledge with state‑of‑the‑art causal techniques, Causal‑Copilot lets researchers focus on scientific insight instead of implementation details.

## Features

- **Automated Causal Analysis** – An LLM automatically picks and tunes the best causal‑analysis algorithms, embedding expert heuristics so users need no specialized knowledge.  
- **Statistical + LLM Post‑Processing** – Performs bootstrap edge‑uncertainty checks and refines the causal graph (pruning, edge re‑direction) using the LLM’s prior knowledge.  
- **Chat‑Style Interface** – Users steer the entire analysis via natural dialogue and receive clear visualizations of data stats and causal graphs—no technical setup required.  
- **Complete Analysis Report** – Outputs a concise PDF that documents methods, shows intuitive visuals, and explains key findings.  
- **Extensible Framework** – Open interfaces let developers plug in new causal algorithms or external libraries with minimal effort.

### Architecture Details

- **Causal‑Copilot** adopts a modular architecture built around five primary components—**Simulation, User Interaction, Preprocessing, Algorithm Selection,** and **Postprocessing**—that together deliver an end‑to‑end causal analysis pipeline. A large language model (LLM) sits at the core of the framework, coordinating data flow among these modules while tapping into auxiliary resources such as a causality‑focused knowledge base and a library of local algorithms. All modules communicate via unified interfaces that pass structured metadata and intermediate results, allowing the LLM to supervise execution seamlessly. This organization preserves clear separation of concerns, simplifies extension, and makes it straightforward to integrate new capabilities into the system.

</h1>

- The pip-installable package ships **19 causal discovery algorithms** across 5 families (constraint-based, score-based, functional, hybrid, time-series), with automatic dependency probing so only algorithms whose backends are installed are offered. The full research system (run from source) additionally supports causal inference and report generation.

</h1>

### Autonomous Workflow

- Powered by an integrated LLM, **Causal‑Copilot** delivers a fully autonomous causal‑analysis pipeline. A user simply uploads a tabular dataset and a natural‑language query. The LLM—augmented by rule‑based routines—parses the query, cleans the data, infers variable types, and fills in missing values. It then chooses the best causal method, tunes its hyperparameters, and generates the code to run it. After execution (e.g., producing a causal graph), the LLM checks for inconsistencies, optionally queries the user for clarification, and can chain additional steps—such as effect or counterfactual estimation—on top of the discovered structure. The system concludes by compiling an interpretable PDF report that summarizes the data, details intermediate choices, and visualizes the final causal results, making the analysis accessible to non‑experts.

</h1>

### Evaluation on Simulated Data

- To test Causal‑Copilot thoroughly, we built a concise yet diverse evaluation suite. Synthetic tabular datasets vary in variable count, graph density, functional form (linear vs. non‑linear), and noise levels. Synthetic time‑series data vary in dimensionality, length, lag structure, and noise type. We also create compound benchmarks, e.g., clinical, financial, and IoT scenarios—that bundle multiple challenges to mimic real‑world complexity. Each dataset has a known ground‑truth graph, allowing us to measure how well the automated pipeline discovers causal structure under a wide range of conditions.
- The results show that our Causal-Copilot can achieve much better performance, indicating the effectiveness of its automatic algorithm selection and hyper-parameter setting strategy, in a autonomous manner.

## Scope & Boundaries

Causal-Copilot produces **exploratory** causal graphs, not confirmatory evidence. Results depend on algorithm assumptions (faithfulness, sufficiency, linearity, etc.) and data quality.

**What it does well:**
- Automated algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning for tabular data
- Reproducible results with full provenance tracking (seed, params, environment)
- 19 algorithms via pip package (5 families: constraint, score, functional, hybrid, time-series), 27+ via full source

**What it does NOT do:**
- Prove causation from observational data alone
- Handle image, text, or unstructured data
- Replace domain expertise for interpreting results

Always validate discovered edges against domain knowledge before making decisions.

### Two Surfaces

| | Core | Agent |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** | `pip install causal-copilot` | `pip install causal-copilot[agent]` |
| **Algorithms** | 19 (constraint, score, functional, hybrid, time-series) | 19 + LLM-driven selection |
| **LLM required** | No — offline, deterministic | Yes — LLM selects algorithm, tunes hyperparameters |
| **Directory** | `causal_copilot/core/` + `causal_copilot/algorithms/` | `causal_copilot/agent/` (wraps core) |
| **Stability** | Stable, tested, pip-installable | Stable with graceful fallback to rule-based |

The core **never** imports from the agent. This boundary is enforced by CI.
